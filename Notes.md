what do I want? what could a man in 30 possibly want?

cars? house? PC? gaming console? power tools?
no cars, too expensive, no need, no bikes either, not time and not enough riding

house? not enough money bro

gaming console? already have win max 2 and switch, current windows handhelds dont really satisfy the portable gaming needs

power tools? not really they aren't expensive anyway

cnc? 3D printer? can do with the basics

PC? yes!



if i am not going to AU for another 3 years, I then have more time to prepare for what's coming.

before I am 35 years old.
